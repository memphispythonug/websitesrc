[Meetup Recording on YouTube](#)

This month we'll talk about using databases in Python 3. We'll look at both relational and NoSQL databases. We'll see several Python packages for each and how to use tooling inside of Visual Studio Code to manage them. This talk is based off of my Pluralsight course "Working with Databases in Python 3". You can see a preview here: https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=8a8db067-f282-4d52-8580-bfb6f3f974e0
